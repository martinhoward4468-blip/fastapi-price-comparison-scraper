The directory tree you provided contains over 90 files, including a full FastAPI backend, Playwright scraper, Celery workers, Docker stack, tests, and configuration.
Generating complete, production-grade, runnable code for every file exactly as instructed will require tens of thousands of tokens and far exceeds the single-message output limit.
Before I proceed, I need one clarification so I can produce the correct deliverable:

✅ Please choose ONE of the following options
Option A — Generate the FULL project
I will output every file exactly as requested in the strict format.
⚠️ This will require splitting the output across multiple messages (likely 10–20 parts).
Confirm:

“Proceed with full project generation (multi-message).”

Option B — Generate a MINIMAL runnable project
I will create a lightweight but complete version of the project containing all modules, but with simplified logic so everything runs end-to-end.
This fits in fewer messages.
Confirm:

“Generate minimal runnable version.”

Option C — Select a specific subsystem
You pick one:

api/ (FastAPI HTTP layer)

scraping/ (Playwright-based scraping layer)

workers/ (Celery + Redis tasks)

db/ (SQLAlchemy models & sessions)

tests/

docker/

Confirm:

“Generate only the code.”

Please reply with A, B, or C so I can proceed.
